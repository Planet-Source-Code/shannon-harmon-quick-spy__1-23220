### Description

A sort of programmer's tool, just look at the screen shot. It deals mostly with windows hWnds, and has a few more utils built in. I added a nice screenshot/capture utility to have handy and also a code generator for outputting the code needed to find a window. Download and look, it's worth it. Wrote it mostly as a tool for myself, but I am sure it will come in handy for others, so here ya go.
